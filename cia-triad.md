CIA Triad

What is the CIA Triad?

In today's time, technology is used for many purposes like banking, shopping, booking tickets etc by individiuals, companies and organizations. Due to this dependence on technology, cyberattacks are very prominent. The CIA Triad is a design model which is used for information security and thus to prevent cybercrimes. CIA Triad consists of:

C - CONFIDENTIALITY
I - INTEGRITY
A - AVAILABILITY



Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a very important aspect to create good information security. It involves that the data remains private and confidential of individuals and companies. To maintain confidentiality, access to data must be controlled by giving access to only the authorized people. Access should be restricted so that unauthorized people don't get their hands on the confidential data.  It's main goal is to prevent unauthorized access.

Real-life examples:

- Not sharing your password with anyone

- Locking your phone so strangers can't open it

- Websites using encryption (HTTPS) so hackers can't read your data

Integrity

Integrity is an aspect in which the application can guarantee you consistency, accuracy and keeps the data clean and correct. An application will show integrity when the stored data is authentic, secure, accurate, and reliable, or in other words, free from interference. And it is important to remember, companies are also required to understand the quality of each of their data to maintain data integrity. Data can be damaged (corruption), inconsistency (various copies of data that do not match the original) and redundancy (the same data stored in the same location or multiple locations).

Real-life examples:

- Checking if a downloaded file is original and not damaged.

- Regular integrity checks to ensure files have not been modified or duplicated without authorization.

- Banks ensuring your account balance doesn’t randomly change.


Availability

Availability is the third aspect of CIA Triad without which the above two aspects become useless. Information should be accessible whenever needed. Applications, systems and networks should be accessible whenever needed and they should function properly. Points such as proper power supply, access of internet should be ensured so that data access can be done without disruptions.

Real-life examples:

- Websites staying up 24/7

- Having backup if system goes down or if there is a power outage.

- Servers not crashing.


Conclusion

These three aspects are intertwined and should be present to ensure information security.
