- Accessing a file '--spaces in this filename--' , starts with a hyphen and has spaces in between.

- Use quotes while writing commands for such files like "--spaces in this filename--" OR escape spaces, --spaces\\ in\\ this\\ filename--

- Using spaces can lead to technical complications, especially when working with command-line interfaces, scripting, or web protocols.
